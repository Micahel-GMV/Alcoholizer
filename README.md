      Many alcohol drinks producers use some marketing like changing bottle volume 
   a little or reducing alcohol concentration to force a buyer to buy their product. 
   You think you`re buying really cheap beer while buying a tinted smelly water wich 
   won`t bring you drunkeness. This project brings price of drinks to price of vodka 
   shot or a glass of beer to help to buy the cheapest alcohol in shop. Please drink 
   responsibly. Never drive drunk and don`t exceed your alcohol measure.


    This is tutorial project based on different tutorials, lessons and articles.
